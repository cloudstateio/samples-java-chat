# Cloudstate samples

## Chat Presence service - Java implementation

This is an implementation of the presence service, which is part of Akka Serverless Chat sample.

The user code is written in Java and uses a 100% Java toolchain (no Scala tools needed).

### Preparing to build

Install Maven

http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

### Build the package and Docker image

You need to specify your own Docker repository when building images. For example if your Docker hub name is justinhj you would do the following:

```
mvn package
mvn -Ddocker.name=justinhj/java-presence io.fabric8:docker-maven-plugin:0.26.1:build
```

### Push the image

```
mvn -Ddocker.name=justinhj/java-presence io.fabric8:docker-maven-plugin:0.26.1:push
```

### Basic Testing

One way to test your service is to run it in a Docker container, and have it connect to the Cloudstate side-car (also known as Cloudstate proxy). The following steps will allow you test the presence service.

In a terminal run the Cloudstate side-car:

`docker run -it --rm --network mynetwork --name cloudstate -p 9000:9000 cloudstateio/cloudstate-proxy-dev-mode -Dcloudstate.proxy.user-function-port=8080 -Dcloudstate.proxy.user-function-interface=java-presence`

Open a second terminal to run the presence user function container (built as above).

`docker run -it --rm --name java-presence --network mynetwork justinhj/java-presence`

In a third terminal window simulate a user connecting to the service with grpcurl.

`grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "Alice"}' localhost:9000 cloudstate.samples.chat.presence.Presence/Connect`

Repeat as many times as you feel like, watch the user count increase in the debug output of the second terminal.

Now open a terminal to test the monitor call.

`grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"name": "Alice"}' localhost:9000 cloudstate.samples.chat.presence.Presence/Monitor`
